    <section class="footer">
        <p>Hello, I'm Sabine Laurence, a passionate second-year student pursuing a combined major in Computer Science
            and Economics at Northeastern University. I believe in the power of merging technology and economics to
            drive innovation and create meaningful solutions for real-world challenges.</p>
        <p>My academic journey has been an exciting one, marked by unique experiences that have shaped my perspective.
            From studying abroad in London during my first semester of college to immersing myself in the world of
            Computer Science despite having no prior experience, I've embraced every opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
        <p>I take pride in my ability to excel in my classes and acquire new skills in Computer Science, even without
            a previous background. Alongside my academic pursuits, my "people" experience is a defining aspect of who I
            am. Working in customer service throughout high school and participating in speech and debate have honed my
            communication and interpersonal skills, giving me a well-rounded approach to problem-solving and
            collaboration.</p>
        <p>As I continue my academic journey, I'm excited to leverage my unique blend of knowledge and experiences to
            contribute positively to the worlds of technology and economics. Join me as I explore the intersection of
            these fields and strive to make a meaningful impact.<br>
            Let's connect and explore together. Feel free to reach out through LinkedIn to join the conversation!
        </p>
