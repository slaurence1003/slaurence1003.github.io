                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Sabine! As a second-year college student pursuing a combined major in Computer Science and Economics, I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive economic growth and innovation. I grew up immersed in the tech world, in the heart of Silicon Valley, so talking and learning about technological advancements has always been second nature to me.</p>

                <p>In the world of Computer Science, I've developed a solid foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and HTML, and have honed my problem-solving skills through various coding projects. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and explore the latest advancements in tech.</p>

                <p>On the Economics front, I have a keen interest in understanding how economic principles drive decision-making in the digital age. My coursework has equipped me with a strong analytical mindset, and I'm excited to apply economic insights to real-world scenarios.</p>

                <p>I am currently on the lookout for an internship opportunity that allows me to blend my technical skills with my economic knowledge. Whether it's working on innovative software solutions or analyzing market trends, I'm eager to contribute my skills and learn from experienced professionals. I'm particularly interested in gaining more experience in the software development industry.</p>

                <p>Feel free to connect with me to discuss internship opportunities, share insights, or engage in meaningful conversations about the fascinating intersection of computer science and economics. You can reach me at laurence.s@northeastern.edu for any inquires or opportunities. I look forward to connecting and learning more!</p>
